          The BharatBenz heavy-duty trucks are built on the Mercedes-Benz Axor
          platform, and the medium-duty trucks on the Fuso Canter and Fuso
          Fighter series. The entire product line meets BSIII standards
          (comparable to Euro III). All BharatBenz (17 models) trucks are slated

          competition. The Fuso medium and heavy-duty trucks produced in Chennai
          are also being exported to markets of Africa and Asia, under Daimler's
          Asia Business Model. BharatBenz crossed 30,000 units sale mark in

          From November 2015, Daimler India Commercial Vehicles started delivery
          of its first set of made-in-India buses. The front engine buses
          are branded as BharatBenz and are based on the Mitsubishi Fuso Canter
          platform. These are available in school, staff and tourist variants.
          The rear engine buses are branded as Mercedes-Benz and are based on
          the Mercedes-Benz O-500 series. Daimler India Commercial Vehicles have
          tied-up with Ireland-based organisation WrightBus for bus body
          building. WrightBus is known for their unique patented aluminique
          alloy structure, which is lighter and stronger than conventional
          steel, increasing fuel efficiency and making the buses safer.
